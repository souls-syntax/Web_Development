**Semantic Elements**
It is way of things which dedicates that every thing have a specific function basically a good coding practice like you give heading in <h1> tag instead of <p> so there is that.

Ohh revision of thought it's actually practically incoded in HTML like you can just use <div> for all sections but there are specifically made <nav> and <footer> and it's good practice to use them as it makes it easier to use and understand the development.
