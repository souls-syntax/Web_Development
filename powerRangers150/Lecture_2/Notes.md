It's good practice to always name html file as index as it makes it universally compatiable for all device, otherwise it would likely only run on your device, like consider browser calls index.html but its named def.html now it doesn't make sense.


*Navigating file struct*
prev dir = ../ (+1+1-1) -> . = +1 | / -> -1 so results in +1 so one level above
